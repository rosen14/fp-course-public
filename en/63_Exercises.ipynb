Prepared by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), its protagonists are generally the elves who help Santa Claus with\n","preparation of gifts. This exercise corresponds to the [day 1 of 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1):\n","\n","The Elves have to go to the forest to look for food for the deer, which is left across the sea, and they are kind enough to invite him on this mission. The forest is overgrown and difficult to navigate by vehicle or access from the air; whereupon the Elven expedition traditionally goes on foot. As their ships come closer to land, the Elves begin to take inventory of their supplies. An important consideration is food, in particular, the number of calories each Elf takes in (which will be their _input_ from exercise).\n","\n","The Elves take turns writing down the number of calories contained in the different meals, snacks, portions, etc. they have brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates its own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) with a blank line.\n","\n","For example, suppose the Elves finish writing the calories for their items and end up with the following list:\n","\n","```\n","1000\n","2000\n","3000\n","\n","4000\n","\n","5000\n","6000\n","\n","7000\n","8000\n","9000\n","\n","10000\n","```\n","\n","This list represents the calories in the food that five Elves eat:\n","\n","- The first Elf carries food with 1000, 2000 and 3000 calories, a total of 6000 calories.\n","- The second elf carries a food with 4000 calories.\n","- The third Elf carries food with 5,000 and 6,000 calories, a total of 11,000 calories.\n","- The fourth Elf carries food with 7,000, 8,000 and 9,000 calories, a total of 24,000 calories.\n","- The fifth Elf carries a food with 10,000 calories.\n","\n","In case the Elves are hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know how many calories the Elf with the most calories is carrying. In the example above, this is 24000 (the fourth Elf).\n","\n","- Find the leprechaun that has the most calories. How many total calories does that elf have?\n","\n","By the time one finds the answer to the Elves' question, they have already figured out that the Elf who carries the most food calories might run out of food. To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would like to know the total calories carried by the three Elves who carry the most calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.\n","\n","In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24,000 calories), then the third Elf (with 11,000 calories), then the fifth Elf (with 10,000 calories). The sum of the calories that these three goblins carry is 45,000.\n","\n","- Find the top three Elves that carry the most calories. How many calories do those goblins have in total?\n","\n","The complete file with the caloric inventory of the Elves is located at [here](../data/AoC/2022/1/input)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Students taking courses\n","\n","Consider the following types of data:\n","\n","```fsharp \n","\n","type Career = \n","    | Engineering of string \n","    | Physics\n","\n","\n","type Student = \n","    {\n","        Name: string \n","        Career: Career \n","    }\n","\n","type Participant = \n","    | NonRegular of string \n","    | Regular of Student \n","\n","type Course = \n","    {\n","        Name: string\n","        Participants: Participant list \n","    }\n","```\n","\n","Write functions associated with these data types that allow you to:\n","\n","- Create a course with a list of students\n","- Add a student to a course\n","- Withdraw a student from a course\n","- Change a student's major\n","\n","Suppose now that the `Course` type is required to be modified, to consider the possibility that a course is approved for a particular series of majors, or\n","for all of them.\n","\n","```fsharp\n","\n","type AcceptedCareers = \n","    // Your code here \n","\n","type Course = \n","    {\n","        Name: string\n","        Participants: Participant list \n","        AcceptedCareers: AcceptedCareers \n","    }\n","```\n","\n","- Fill in the data type `AcceptedCareers`\n","- Modify the functions of the first part, in such a way that they validate if a participant can enroll in a particular course, according to whether he is a student\n","or not, and to the race that follows.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Separating into syllables\n","\n","One of the benefits of the Spanish language, or Castilian as we call it in these latitudes, is\n","that there are clear rules for [perform the separation of a word into syllables](https://unibetas.com/como-separar-silabas).

Starting\n","Apart from this, there is a set of rules that are used to determine hyphenation.\n","Some of them are:\n","\n","- Consonants at the beginning of a word: All consonants found at the beginning of a word must go without exception with the vowel that follows them.\n","\n","- A consonant located between two vowels: If there is a consonant between two vowels in the word, it must accompany the one that follows it:\n","\n","- Two consonants located between two vowels: In this case, the separation of syllables will depend on the specific group of consonants.
