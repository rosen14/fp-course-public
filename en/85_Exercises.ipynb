    "Broadly, the planets are divided into rocky planets (0.5-1.0 R ⊕), super-Earths (1.0-1.75 R ⊕), sub-Neptunes (1.75-3.5 R ⊕), sub-Jovians (3.5-6.0 R ⊕), and Jovians (6-14.3 R ⊕) based on their planet mass sizes, and “hot,” “warm,” and “cold” based on the incident stellar flux (See [this paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...856..122K/abstract)).\n",

    "- Learn how to change the background of a Plotly graph so our exoplanet census resembles more the one at NASA's site.\n",
    "- Learn how to fix the color of each trace to match the ones at NASA's site (in our example, the colors are selected automagically from a given palette.)\n",
